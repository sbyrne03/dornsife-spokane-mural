                <p class="info">
                    The “Garbage Goat” has been a peculiar but well-loved part of Spokane’s 
                    Riverfront Park since 1974. It was originally installed for the Expo ’74 
                    and created by Sister Paula Turnbull, who has many art pieces around 
                    Spokane. The Garbage Goat faced some controversy with dairy goat owners 
                    who were unhappy with how the sculpture shows a goat eating trash. 
                    Nevertheless, the Garbage Goat was and still is a delight for visitors 
                    to feed trash into!

                    When visiting Downtown Spokane, it is hard to miss the Pavilion in 
                    Riverfront Park. The U.S. Federal Pavilion was a gift to Spokane from the 
                    U.S. government for Expo ’74. Renovations in 2019 transformed the Pavilion 
                    into what it is today – an open-air venue with a 40-foot-tall viewing 
                    platform, tiered seating, and LED light blades. The Pavilion is host to 
                    a variety of concerts and events but is interesting to visit regardless.

                <h1>North Clocktower</h1>
                <p class="info">
                    The Great Northern Clocktower – commonly known as the Clock Tower – stands 
                    in the middle of Riverfront Park in Downtown Spokane. A century ago, it 
                    was surrounded by railroads as part of the Great Northern railroad station. 
                    The railroads first connected Spokane to other mining and agricultural 
                    towns in the late 1800s, but soon became part of transcontinental lines as 
                    Spokane grew into a city. The station was a source of pride and essential 
                    in Spokane’s industrial and social development. As new structures, such as 
                    the Monroe Street Bridge, were built, Spokane’s railroads were contributing 
                    less to the city and were becoming more of a nuisance. The railroads and the 
                    station were removed for Expo ‘74 and the Clock Tower remains as a reminder 
                    of the city’s history.

                    On the first Sunday in May every year, thousands of runners run 12 
                    kilometers (7.5 miles) around Downtown Spokane as part of the Lilac 
                    Bloomsday Run. It was first held in 1977 and has become an annual event 
                    that attracts runners near and far. The running route starts in Downtown 
                    Spokane and ends at Monroe Street Bridge, offering runners a view of 
                    the Spokane River for most of the course with the Spokane Falls greeting

                    Spokane’s location in the Inland Northwest allows for easy access to 
                    many beautiful hiking trails, with variety in difficulty levels and 
                    views. One of the trails with access within Downtown Spokane is the 
                    Centennial Trail – a 40-mile trail with 18 trailheads spanning eastern 
                    Washington and Idaho. The convenient trailhead located in Downtown 
                    Spokane winds along the river for easy access to local shops, eateries, 
                    and views. Another popular location for trails is the Riverside State 
                    Park – the largest state park in Washington! The Bowl and Pitcher area 
                    of Riverside is particularly popular for picturesque views of a 
                    suspension bridge and the surrounding geological formations around 
                    the river.

                    The Spokane River is important to Spokane and the life that resides 
                    there because it provides affordable power, along with a variety of 
                    resources. There are great historical events that allowed Spokane 
                    to grow into the city it is today, with the Spokane River playing a 
                    role in the city’s growth. Historically, Native Americans used this 
                    river to fish for salmon and travel to feed their families. In 1807, 
                    an Englishman named David Thompson created the first trading post 
                    along the Spokane river, which created a multi-cultural trading 
                    system that led to increased development.

                <p class="info">
                    Opening with just under 1,000 seats in 1945, this classical movie theater was 
                    one of the most successful attractions in Spokane for young individuals. This 
                    historic movie theater received congratulatory telegrams from celebrities such 
                    as Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour and contained many market innovations, like 
                    having a record and gift shop inside the theater). After closing briefly 
                    during the early 1960s, this theater was restored in 1999. Its original charm 
                    is retained whilst also modernizing the sound/visuals and remaining family-friendly 
                    and affordable.
